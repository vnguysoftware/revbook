## 1. Logo Prompts

### Direction A: Minimal Wordmark with Analysis Element

```
Design a minimal wordmark logo for "RevBack", a B2B SaaS AI-powered billing investigation
platform. The word "RevBack" should be rendered in a clean, geometric sans-serif typeface
similar to Inter or Aktiv Grotesk. The "Rev" portion should be in color #4f6ef7 (medium
blue) and "Back" should be in color #1a2d6d (dark navy).

Subtle AI/analysis element: integrate a small, refined detail that suggests intelligent
analysis. Options: a very subtle lens or magnifying element incorporated into one
letterform (e.g., the "B" or the "a" of "Back"), or a single thin diagonal line through
one letter suggesting a scan or analysis pass. The element should be minimal enough that
at first glance it reads as pure typography, and only on closer look does the analysis
motif become apparent.

Letterforms should be slightly condensed with generous letter-spacing. No icon, no
separate symbol -- just enhanced typography. The style should feel modern, technical,
intelligent, and trustworthy -- similar to the Stripe or Linear wordmarks but with a
hint of analytical precision.

Transparent background. Suitable for use at sizes from 24px to 200px tall.

Do NOT include gradients, shadows, 3D effects, decorative serifs, rounded/playful
letterforms, robot imagery, circuit patterns, brain imagery, or anything that reads
as "sci-fi AI." The intelligence should feel like smart analysis, not artificial
intelligence. Do NOT include a tagline or subtext.

Output dimensions: 1200x400 pixels with generous padding.
```

### Direction B: Icon + Text with Intelligence Motif (Recommended for Primary Use)

```
Design a logo for "RevBack", an AI-powered billing investigation platform for subscription
companies. The logo has two parts: a compact geometric icon on the left, and the wordmark
"RevBack" on the right.

Icon: A stylized analysis or investigation symbol composed of clean geometric lines.
The icon should suggest both "intelligent investigation" and "data convergence/clarity."
Consider: an abstract magnifying lens with data lines converging through it, a geometric
eye-like shape made of intersecting data streams (suggesting pattern recognition, not
surveillance), or overlapping rectangles with a subtle focal point suggesting analysis
and insight. The icon should convey: "this system sees patterns and investigates them."

The icon should be a single color: #4f6ef7 (medium blue). It must be recognizable at
32x32 pixels and look sharp at 256x256 pixels.

Wordmark: "RevBack" in a clean geometric sans-serif typeface. All one color: #1a2d6d
(dark navy). Slightly bold weight.

The overall style should be professional, technical, and enterprise-ready -- similar to
Datadog, Sentry, or PagerDuty logos. The AI/intelligence feel should come through as
"smart analysis tool" not "robot" or "brain." Think of how Palantir or Notion suggest
intelligence through geometry rather than literal AI imagery.

Transparent background. The icon and text should have clear spacing and work well when
separated (icon alone for favicons, full logo for headers).

Do NOT include: gradients, glossy effects, overly complex icons with many small details,
cartoon elements, cryptocurrency/blockchain aesthetics, lock/padlock icons, dollar signs,
literal brain or neural network imagery, robot faces, circuit board patterns, or the
letters "AI" as part of the icon. Do NOT use purple/violet in the logo -- save that for
marketing materials.

Output dimensions: 1600x400 pixels with padding.
```

### Direction C: Abstract Intelligence Symbol

```
Design an abstract logo symbol for "RevBack", an AI-powered billing investigation
platform. No text, just the symbol.

The symbol should represent the concept of "intelligent investigation" or "data streams
converging into insight." Consider: multiple data lines flowing into a focal point that
suggests analysis and understanding, an abstract geometric form that evokes both a lens
(investigation) and a node (intelligence), or intersecting geometric planes that create
a sense of "looking through data to find the answer."

The mark should feel like it belongs to a company that finds hidden patterns in complex
data. It should evoke analysis, precision, and clarity -- not automation or robotics.

Color: Solid #4f6ef7 (medium blue) on transparent background. The symbol must work as
a single flat color with no gradients. It should be geometric, not organic. Sharp edges,
not rounded or bubbly. It should be instantly recognizable at 16x16 pixels (favicon size)
and elegant at 512x512 pixels.

Style references: the Palantir logo (geometric, intelligence-focused), the Linear icon
(minimal, precise), the Raycast icon (clean geometric mark). The overall mood should be:
precise, investigative, intelligent, confident.

Do NOT include: text, gradients, shadows, 3D effects, circles-within-circles cliches,
generic "tech" swooshes, shield icons, dollar/currency symbols, literal eye imagery
(too surveillance), brain imagery (too literal), or circuit board patterns.

Output dimensions: 1024x1024 pixels with transparent background and generous padding.
```

---

## 2. Hero Illustration (Landing Page)

```
Create a hero illustration for the landing page of RevBack, an AI-powered billing
investigation platform for subscription companies. The illustration should convey the
concept of "AI analyzing billing data streams to find and investigate issues."

Composition: A wide, horizontal illustration showing data streams flowing from three
sources on the left (representing Stripe, Apple, and Google billing systems -- shown as
abstract geometric shapes, not literal logos). The streams converge toward a central
analysis zone -- a glowing, precise geometric form that represents the AI investigation
engine. This central element should feel active and intelligent: think of a lens or prism
that data passes through, where patterns become visible and issues are identified.

On the right side of the central analysis zone, the output: clean, organized insight
cards emerge -- each with a severity indicator (red, amber, green dots), a root cause
label (suggested as a horizontal text bar), and a confidence indicator. One card should
be slightly larger and "open," showing a simplified investigation output with lines
suggesting analysis text.

Between the input streams and the analysis zone, subtle visual elements should suggest
the AI is doing work: thin connection lines, small node points where data is being
cross-referenced, and gentle pulse animations (implied through motion blur or glow
effects on specific connection points).

Visual style: Flat illustration with subtle depth. Clean vector art, not photorealistic.
Isometric or 2.5D perspective. Similar to the illustration style used on Stripe's
documentation pages, Linear's marketing site, or Vercel's landing page -- modern SaaS
illustration with geometric precision.

Color palette:
- Primary surfaces and UI elements: #4f6ef7 (medium blue) and #1a2d6d (dark navy)
- The central AI analysis zone: subtle #7c3aed (violet) glow or accent, very restrained
- Background: #e0ebff (light blue) fading to white at the edges
- Accent elements: #ef4444 (red for critical alerts), #f59e0b (amber for warnings),
  #10b981 (green for resolved/healthy)
- Secondary surfaces: white (#ffffff) with subtle #e0ebff borders
- Text elements within the illustration should be suggested with horizontal lines,
  not actual readable text

The data streams should use thin, elegant lines -- not thick pipes or tubes. The AI
analysis zone should feel like an intelligent system working, not a static dashboard.
Include subtle grid lines or dot patterns in the background for depth.

Mood: Precise, intelligent, professional. This illustration should make a VP of
Engineering feel like this is a serious, AI-powered analysis tool -- not a chatbot or
gimmick. The AI element should feel sophisticated and purposeful.

Do NOT include: photographs, human figures or characters, literal credit cards or
dollar bills, phone/device mockups, blockchain/crypto aesthetics, dark/black backgrounds,
excessive gradients, clip art style elements, literal robot or brain imagery, chat
bubbles (this is not a chatbot), or the letters "AI" as visual text in the illustration.

Output dimensions: 2400x1200 pixels (2:1 ratio for hero section). PNG with
transparent or #e0ebff background.
```

## 3. Social Media Templates

### Twitter/X Card (Summary Card with Large Image)

```
Design a Twitter/X social media card for RevBack, an AI-powered billing investigation
platform. This will be used as a summary card with large image for link previews and
promotional tweets.

Layout: Left two-thirds shows a simplified visualization of the RevBack AI investigation
flow. On the left edge, 3-4 small abstract source icons with data lines flowing toward
a central "analysis" element (a subtle geometric focal point suggesting AI processing).
From the analysis point, insight cards emerge on the right -- 3 issue cards with severity
indicators (red, amber, green dots), each with a small text bar suggesting a root cause
finding. One card shows a prominent revenue impact number: "$23,400/month at risk."

Right one-third has a clean panel with the RevBack logo (text "RevBack" in #1a2d6d navy)
and the tagline "Defend every dollar." in smaller text below.

Color palette:
- Background: white (#ffffff)
- Data flow elements: #e0ebff (light blue) with #4f6ef7 (medium blue) accents
- AI analysis focal point: subtle #7c3aed (violet) accent glow
- Issue severity dots: #ef4444 (red), #f59e0b (amber), #10b981 (green)
- Text: #1a2d6d (dark navy)
- Subtle shadow or border around the entire card

Style: Clean, modern data visualization style. Should feel like a product that uses AI
to analyze billing data -- intelligent and precise, not busy or cluttered. Similar to
how Vercel or Linear present product concepts in social media.

Do NOT include: stock photography, human faces, emoji, excessive text, busy patterns,
dark backgrounds, literal AI/robot imagery, chat interfaces, or brain icons.

Output dimensions: 1200x675 pixels (16:9 ratio, Twitter large image card).
```

### LinkedIn Post Image

```
Design a LinkedIn post image for RevBack, an AI-powered billing investigation platform
for subscription companies.

Layout: Clean, professional design split into two sections. Top section (60%) shows a
bold stat or insight -- large text reading "Defend every dollar."
in #1a2d6d (dark navy) on a white background. Below the stat, smaller text: "3-7% of
subscription revenue leaks through billing errors every year. RevBack's AI investigates
every issue -- automatically." Bottom section (40%) has a #4f6ef7 (medium blue)
background with white text: "AI-powered root cause analysis. Incident clustering. Health
insights. 30 minutes to set up." The RevBack logo (wordmark in white) sits in the
bottom-right corner with generous padding.

Typography: Clean sans-serif (similar to Inter or SF Pro). The main headline should be
extra-bold. Body text should be regular weight.

Style: Minimalist corporate design with intelligence implied through precision and
clarity. Think McKinsey or Bain report covers -- clean, data-driven, authoritative.
No illustrations or icons. Just typography and color blocks.

Do NOT include: stock photos, human figures, emojis, decorative borders, gradients,
clip art, literal AI imagery, or robot/brain icons. Do NOT use more than 3 colors
(navy, blue, white).

Output dimensions: 1200x1200 pixels (1:1 square, optimal for LinkedIn feed).
```

### Twitter/X Profile Banner

```
Design a Twitter/X profile banner for RevBack, an AI-powered billing investigation
platform.

Layout: Wide horizontal banner. Left-aligned text: "RevBack" in large, bold sans-serif
in #1a2d6d (dark navy), with "AI-powered billing investigation" in smaller text below
in #4f6ef7 (medium blue). The right side of the banner has a subtle, abstract pattern
of thin converging lines in #e0ebff (light blue) that suggest data analysis and pattern
recognition -- lines flowing toward a focal point. The pattern should feel like
intelligent data processing, not a static grid. Leave the center area relatively empty --
Twitter overlays the profile photo there.

Background: White (#ffffff) or very light #f8faff.

Style: Ultra-clean and minimal. Similar to Stripe's or Linear's Twitter banners. The
text should be positioned in the left 40% of the banner to avoid being covered by
the profile image and bio.

Do NOT include: taglines longer than 5 words, logos in the center (profile photo
covers it), busy backgrounds, photos, dark color schemes, literal AI imagery, or
robot/brain icons.

Output dimensions: 1500x500 pixels (3:1 ratio, Twitter banner spec).
```

---

## 4. Favicon / App Icon

### Favicon (Browser Tab)

```
Design a favicon for RevBack, an AI-powered billing investigation platform. The favicon
must be extremely simple and recognizable at 16x16 and 32x32 pixel sizes.

The favicon should be a single geometric symbol derived from the RevBack brand that
subtly suggests analysis or investigation. Options:
- A stylized "R" letterform in #4f6ef7 (medium blue) with one element that suggests
  a lens or analysis focal point -- geometric, not script
- The abstract icon from the logo (if Direction B or C was chosen), simplified to its
  most basic form
- A minimal geometric form that combines a data node with an analysis lens -- two
  overlapping shapes creating a focal point

The symbol must be a single flat color (#4f6ef7 medium blue) on a transparent background.
At 16x16 pixels, every detail must still be distinguishable. Avoid thin lines that
disappear at small sizes. The analysis/intelligence motif should be implied through
geometry, not added detail.

Style: Geometric, crisp, pixel-perfect. Similar to how Vercel (triangle), Notion (N),
or Linear (angle bracket) handle their favicons -- one simple, unmistakable shape.
The shape should hint at "this tool analyzes and investigates."

Do NOT include: text (too small to read), gradients, multiple colors, rounded corners
on the overall shape (the browser adds those for app icons), literal eye or brain shapes,
or any detail that won't survive 16x16 rendering.

Output: Two versions -- 16x16 pixels and 32x32 pixels. PNG with transparent background.
Also provide a 180x180 pixel version for Apple Touch Icon (same design, add 20% padding
and a white #ffffff background fill behind the symbol, with rounded corners).
```

### App Icon (PWA / Desktop)

```
Design an app icon for RevBack, an AI-powered billing investigation platform. This will
be used for PWA (Progressive Web App) installations, desktop shortcuts, and app store
listings if needed.

The icon should feature the RevBack symbol (the geometric analysis/investigation icon
from the logo) centered on a #4f6ef7 (medium blue) background. The symbol itself should
be white (#ffffff). The icon should have subtle rounded corners (following Apple's
superellipse radius for iOS icons, approximately 22.37% corner radius).

The symbol should fill approximately 60% of the icon area, with 20% padding on each side.
Clean and bold enough to be recognizable at 64x64 pixels but detailed enough to look
sharp at 1024x1024 pixels. The symbol should carry the analysis/intelligence motif from
the main logo.

Style: Flat, modern app icon. Similar to the Slack, Notion, or Linear app icons --
clean color background with a white symbol. No gradients, no shadows, no gloss effects.

Do NOT include: text, photographic elements, complex illustrations, multiple colors
beyond the blue background and white symbol, literal brain or eye imagery, or circuit
patterns.

Output dimensions: 1024x1024 pixels. PNG with no transparency (solid background).
Also provide variants at: 512x512, 256x256, 192x192, 128x128, 64x64 pixels.
```

---

## 5. OG Image (Open Graph / Link Preview)

```
Design an Open Graph image for RevBack, an AI-powered billing investigation platform.
This image appears when the RevBack website URL is shared on social media, messaging
apps, or Slack.

Layout: Horizontal rectangle. Clean, two-column design.

Left column (55%):
- RevBack logo (wordmark "RevBack" in #1a2d6d dark navy) at the top-left with padding
- Main headline below: "Defend every dollar." in #1a2d6d (dark navy),
  bold sans-serif, large enough to read in a thumbnail
- Subtext below the headline: "We watch your revenue so nothing slips through." in #4f6ef7 (medium blue), smaller font

Right column (45%):
- A simplified, stylized visualization of the AI investigation flow. Data lines converge
  from 3 small source indicators toward a central analysis point, which outputs an
  investigation card. The card shows: a severity dot (red #ef4444), a root cause label
  bar, a confidence indicator (0.94), and a revenue impact line ($14.99/mo). The card
  should have a subtle drop shadow and slightly rounded corners to look like a floating
  product element.
- The analysis focal point has a very subtle #7c3aed (violet) glow to suggest AI
  processing.

Background: Solid white (#ffffff) with a subtle #e0ebff (light blue) geometric pattern
in the bottom-right corner for visual interest.

A thin #4f6ef7 (medium blue) line or border along the very bottom of the image serves
as a brand accent.

Typography: Clean sans-serif throughout (Inter or SF Pro style). Headlines bold,
body text regular weight.

Style: Professional, clean, SaaS-standard with an intelligence-forward feel. Similar to
how Stripe, Vercel, or Linear present their OG images -- product-focused, not
marketing-fluffy. Should look credible in a Slack channel full of engineers.

Do NOT include: photographs, human figures, cartoon illustrations, excessive text,
dark backgrounds, busy patterns, literal AI/robot imagery, chat bubbles, brain icons,
or more than 5 colors.

Output dimensions: 1200x630 pixels (standard OG image ratio). PNG format.
```

---

## 6. Pitch Deck Slide Backgrounds / Templates

### Title Slide Background

```
Design a pitch deck title slide background for RevBack, an AI-powered billing
investigation platform.

The background should be predominantly white (#ffffff) with subtle geometric accents
that suggest intelligent analysis. In the bottom-right corner, a cluster of thin,
converging diagonal lines in #e0ebff (light blue) creates a subtle pattern that suggests
data flowing toward an analysis point. A very faint #7c3aed (violet, approximately 5%
opacity) glow sits at the convergence point, barely visible, suggesting an AI processing
element.

The lines should be very light -- almost invisible -- so they don't compete with text
placed over the slide.

A thin horizontal line in #4f6ef7 (medium blue) runs across the bottom 5% of the slide
as a brand accent bar.

The top-left corner should be completely clean white (this is where the title text will go).

Style: Ultra-minimal, premium, with a hint of intelligence. Think Apple keynote
backgrounds with a subtle nod to data analysis. The background should make any text
placed on it look elegant and professional.

Do NOT include: gradients covering more than 20% of the slide, any text, logos,
dark colors, busy patterns, photographic elements, literal AI imagery, or brain/circuit
motifs.

Output dimensions: 1920x1080 pixels (16:9 standard presentation slide). PNG.
```

### Content Slide Background

```
Design a pitch deck content slide background for RevBack, an AI-powered billing
investigation platform. This template will be used for slides with text, charts,
and tables.

The background is white (#ffffff). A very subtle dot grid pattern in #e0ebff (light blue,
approximately 10% opacity) covers the entire slide -- dots spaced 40px apart. This creates
a barely-visible structure that gives the slide a technical, precise feel without
interfering with content readability.

A thin vertical accent bar (4px wide) in #4f6ef7 (medium blue) runs along the left edge
of the slide from top to bottom.

A single very thin line (#e0ebff, 1px) connects from the bottom of the vertical accent
bar diagonally to the bottom-right corner at approximately 8% opacity -- barely visible,
suggesting a data flow pathway.

The right side and bottom of the slide are otherwise completely clean.

Style: Minimal, technical, grid-like. Similar to engineering documentation or technical
specification backgrounds. The goal is to make data, text, and charts placed on this
background look organized and precise.

Do NOT include: any text, decorative elements in the content area, gradients, dark colors,
photos, or any element that would interfere with overlaid content.

Output dimensions: 1920x1080 pixels (16:9). PNG.
```

### Section Divider Slide Background

```
Design a pitch deck section divider slide background for RevBack, an AI-powered billing
investigation platform. This is used between major sections of the presentation.

The entire slide background is #1a2d6d (dark navy). In the center, a large, subtle
geometric pattern made of thin converging lines in #4f6ef7 (medium blue, approximately
15% opacity) creates visual interest. The lines should converge toward a central focal
point, suggesting analysis and investigation -- data flowing toward insight. At the
convergence point, a very subtle #7c3aed (violet, approximately 8% opacity) glow
suggests AI processing.

The text on these slides will be white (#ffffff) and large, centered on the slide.
The background pattern should not interfere with text readability.

A thin horizontal accent line in #4f6ef7 (medium blue, full opacity) runs across the
slide at approximately 70% from the top, serving as a subtle visual anchor.

Style: Bold, confident, dark, intelligent. Similar to how Pitch.com or Canva premium
templates handle section dividers -- a moment of visual contrast that signals "we're
moving to a new topic." The dark navy with the subtle convergence pattern should feel
sophisticated and analytical.

Do NOT include: any text, gradients that wash out the navy, photographic elements,
patterns that are too busy or distracting, literal AI imagery, brain/circuit motifs,
or any color outside the brand palette (navy, blue, violet, white).

Output dimensions: 1920x1080 pixels (16:9). PNG.
```

### Data/Chart Slide Background

```
Design a pitch deck background specifically for slides that will contain charts,
tables, and data visualizations for RevBack, an AI-powered billing investigation platform.

Background: Clean white (#ffffff). A very faint horizontal rule in #e0ebff (light blue)
sits at approximately 15% from the top, creating a natural header zone above it and a
content zone below. This rule helps visually separate the slide title area from the
data area.

Below the rule, the slide is completely clean white to maximize contrast for charts
and tables. No patterns, no dots, no textures in the data area.

The left edge has the same thin vertical accent bar (4px wide) in #4f6ef7 (medium blue)
as the content slide.

A small RevBack logo watermark (the icon only, not wordmark) sits in the bottom-right
corner at approximately 5% opacity in #4f6ef7 -- barely visible but present for
brand consistency. The icon should carry the analysis/investigation motif.

Style: Clinical, data-focused. The background should make numbers, charts, and tables
the absolute center of attention. Similar to how consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain)
format their data slides -- maximum whitespace, minimal decoration.

Do NOT include: any text, decorative elements in the data area, dark backgrounds,
gradients, or any element that could reduce the readability of overlaid charts or tables.

Output dimensions: 1920x1080 pixels (16:9). PNG.
```

---

## 7. AI Investigation Flow Diagram

```
Design a visual flow diagram showing how RevBack's AI investigation works. This will
be used in pitch deck slide 6, blog posts, and marketing materials.

The diagram flows left to right across a wide horizontal format.

**Stage 1 -- Detection (left):**
A simplified detector icon (geometric alert shape) with a label bar reading "Issue
Detected." Below it, a small card showing: severity dot (red), issue type bar, user
ID bar. Color: #ef4444 (red) accent on white.

**Stage 2 -- Context Gathering (center-left):**
Five data sources converge into a collection zone:
- "Last 50 Events" (small timeline icon)
- "Entitlements" (small state icon)
- "Cross-Platform IDs" (small identity icon)
- "Related Issues" (small link icon)
- "Similar Issues" (small pattern icon)

Each source is a small card or node connected by thin #4f6ef7 (medium blue) lines
flowing toward the center. The labels should be actual readable text at the output
dimensions.

**Stage 3 -- AI Analysis (center):**
The convergence point: a geometric focal element that represents the AI engine. This
should be the visual centerpiece -- slightly larger, with a subtle #7c3aed (violet)
glow or accent suggesting intelligence. The element should feel like a lens or prism
where data is being analyzed. Label: "AI Investigator" in #1a2d6d (dark navy).

**Stage 4 -- Investigation Output (center-right):**
From the AI analysis element, a structured output card emerges. The card has clear
sections:
- "Root Cause" with a text bar
- "Impact: $14.99/mo" in #ef4444 (red)
- "Confidence: 0.94" with a subtle fill bar in #10b981 (green)
- "Recommendation" with a text bar
- "Related: ISS-2847, ISS-2851" as a small link line

The card should have rounded corners, a subtle drop shadow, and feel like a real
product output.

**Stage 5 -- Action (right):**
The output card connects to action icons: a Slack notification, an email alert, and
a "Resolve" button. These should be small, clean, and secondary to the main flow.

**Connecting lines:**
Thin, elegant lines (#4f6ef7 medium blue, varying opacity) connect each stage.
Small directional arrows or chevrons indicate flow direction. The lines should feel
like data pathways, not plumbing.

**Overall style:**
Clean, technical, infographic-quality. Similar to how Stripe documents their payment
flow or how Datadog shows their data pipeline. White background. Generous whitespace
between stages. Each stage should be clearly distinct but visually connected.

Color palette: White background, #4f6ef7 (blue) for structure and lines, #1a2d6d
(navy) for text, #7c3aed (violet) for AI accent only, #ef4444/#f59e0b/#10b981 for
severity indicators.

Do NOT include: photographs, human figures, literal robot or brain imagery, chat
bubbles, overly complex diagrams with too many crossing lines, dark backgrounds,
gradients as backgrounds, or any element that makes the diagram feel cluttered.

Output dimensions: 2400x800 pixels (3:1 wide ratio for slide embed and blog use).
PNG with white background.
```

## 8. Before/After Comparison

```
Design a before/after comparison illustration for RevBack, an AI-powered billing
investigation platform. This will be used in the pitch deck and on the landing page
to show the transformation from manual triage to AI-powered investigation.

Layout: Two panels side by side, clearly labeled "Before RevBack" (left) and
"With RevBack" (right), separated by a vertical divider or arrow.

**Left Panel -- "Before RevBack" (the painful state):**
Visual chaos representing manual investigation:
- A simplified ops dashboard showing 15 individual alert cards stacked/scattered,
  each with a red or amber severity dot. The cards overlap slightly, creating visual
  noise and overwhelm.
- Above the alerts, a clock icon showing elapsed time: "~30 min per issue"
- A simplified depiction of 3-4 browser tab indicators labeled with text bars
  suggesting "Stripe Dashboard," "App Store Connect," "Internal DB," "Logs" --
  representing the manual investigation workflow across tools
- A subtle confused/overwhelmed indicator: maybe a question mark icon or scattered
  connection lines between the alert cards going nowhere
- Overall color mood: washed out, disorganized. Use #ef4444 (red) and #f59e0b (amber)
  prominently. Desaturated versions of the brand blues. The feeling should be: noisy,
  manual, slow.

**Right Panel -- "With RevBack" (the resolved state):**
Visual clarity representing AI-powered investigation:
- A single clean incident card in the center: "Apple Webhook Disruption Affecting
  iOS Renewals" as the AI-generated title. Severity: Critical. Affected: 15 users.
  Impact: $224/mo. Confidence: 0.94.
- Below the incident card, a simplified investigation output showing: "Root Cause"
  line, "Recommendation" line, "Related Issues" line -- clean and structured
- A small indicator showing "15 alerts -> 1 incident" with the number transformation
  visually clear
- Time indicator: "Investigated in seconds"
- A subtle #7c3aed (violet) glow on the investigation output, suggesting AI analysis
- Overall color mood: clean, organized, resolved. Crisp #4f6ef7 (blue) and #10b981
  (green) accents. Lots of whitespace. The feeling should be: clear, intelligent, fast.

**Divider element:**
Between the two panels, a clear visual separator. Options: a bold right-pointing arrow
in #4f6ef7 (blue), a "vs" label, or a simple vertical line with the RevBack icon
at the midpoint.

**Visual style:**
Clean, flat, infographic-style. Both panels should be stylized product UI, not
photorealistic screenshots. Similar to how SaaS companies show "old way vs. new way"
comparisons on landing pages. The contrast between chaos (left) and clarity (right)
should be immediately obvious even at thumbnail size.

**Text elements:**
Use actual readable text for key labels: "15 alerts," "1 incident," "30 min per issue,"
"Investigated in seconds." Other text elements (issue descriptions, log entries) should
be represented as horizontal bars suggesting text.

Color palette: Left panel desaturated (#ef4444 red, #f59e0b amber, muted blues). Right
panel clean and vibrant (#4f6ef7 blue, #10b981 green, #7c3aed violet accent). White
background for both panels.

Do NOT include: photographs, human figures (no confused/happy person illustrations),
literal robot or brain imagery, dark backgrounds, excessive detail that makes either
panel hard to read at a glance, or more than 6 colors total.

Output dimensions: 2400x1200 pixels (2:1 ratio). PNG with white background. Also
provide a 1200x675 version (16:9) cropped for social media use.
```

---

## Usage Notes

**Color consistency across all assets:**
- Always use exact hex values. Do not allow AI tools to "interpret" or shift colors.
- If the tool output shifts colors, specify "Use exact RGB values: Primary R:79 G:110 B:247, Dark R:26 G:45 B:109, Light R:224 G:235 B:255, Violet R:124 G:58 B:237."
- The violet (#7c3aed) accent is ONLY for AI-specific elements and should always be subtle (low opacity, small area). It should never dominate. If violet is too prominent, reduce opacity or area.

**AI visual language guidelines:**
- DO suggest intelligence through: convergence, focal points, lenses, analysis, clarity emerging from complexity, structured output from unstructured input
- DO NOT suggest AI through: robots, brains, neural networks, circuit boards, glowing eyes, chat bubbles, the letters "AI" as a visual element, sci-fi aesthetics
- The visual language of RevBack's AI should feel like: "a brilliant analyst looking at your data" not "a robot processing your data"

**Iteration tips:**
- If the first generation is close but not right, re-prompt with "Keep the same composition but adjust [specific element]."
- For logos, generate 4-6 variations per direction and select the strongest.
- For the hero illustration, you may need to generate individual components (data streams, AI analysis zone, insight cards) separately and composite them.
- For the AI investigation flow diagram, consider generating it in stages: detection, context gathering, AI analysis, output, actions -- then composite.
- The before/after comparison may work best generated as two separate panels and then placed side by side.
- Always test favicons at actual size (16x16 in a browser tab) before finalizing.
- For any AI accent elements: if the violet (#7c3aed) glow or accent is too strong in the generated output, re-prompt with "reduce the violet/purple element to approximately [X]% opacity" or "make the AI accent more subtle."
