## Template 1: Post-Incident

**Subject:** What if AI told you the root cause in seconds?

Hi [NAME],

I saw [COMPANY] had a billing incident recently. Your team probably spent hours in logs, Slack threads, and dashboards trying to piece together what happened and who was affected.

We built RevBack because we were tired of that exact fire drill. When an issue is detected, our AI investigator automatically gathers the event timeline, analyzes entitlement state across platforms, and tells you the root cause, the blast radius, and what to fix -- in seconds, not hours.

It would have caught your recent incident and told your team exactly what was wrong before customers noticed.

We're running free billing audits. Read-only connection to your Stripe/Apple accounts, immediate results.

15 minutes to show you how it works?

## Template 2: Multi-Platform Pain

**Subject:** 15 alerts, 1 root cause, 0 hours wasted

Hi [NAME],

If [COMPANY] runs subscriptions on Stripe and Apple IAP, you've lived this: 15 separate "paid-no-access" alerts fire over 2 hours. Your team triages each one individually. Three hours later, someone realizes they're all caused by the same Apple webhook outage.

RevBack's AI clusters related issues into a single incident automatically. The first alert triggers an AI investigation that identifies the root cause. When the next 14 arrive, they're grouped under one incident -- "Apple Webhook Outage" -- with a single root cause analysis and fix recommendation.

Apple drops 0.5-2% of notifications silently. Their receipt API rate-limits at ~300 req/min undocumented. RevBack handles all of it.

## Template 3: Engineering Leader

**Subject:** An AI billing engineer that never sleeps

Hi [NAME],

You have monitoring for servers, APIs, and deploys. But when a billing issue fires at 2 AM, someone still has to manually investigate, figure out the root cause, check if other users are affected, and decide what to fix.

RevBack is like having a dedicated billing ops engineer powered by AI. It investigates every detected issue automatically -- analyzing event timelines, entitlement state, and cross-platform data to find root causes. It clusters related alerts into incidents so your team isn't triaging duplicates. It generates daily health reports on your billing system. And it learns from your team's feedback, getting more accurate over time.

No code changes. Read-only. 30-minute setup.

Worth a 15-minute look?
